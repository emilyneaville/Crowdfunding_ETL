<h2> Project 2 - ETL with Crowdfunding Dataset</h2>


For the ETL mini project, we practiced building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
